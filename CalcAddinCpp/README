A Calc Add-In example in C++

The add-in provides functions like EXPO and GETMYFIRSTVALUE (see
CalcAddinCpp_impl.cxx for details).  In an SDK environment, a plain "make"
builds the CalcAddinCpp.oxt extension, and "make install" registers the
extension in the LibreOffice installation.

This example should work at least on Linux (it makes some hard-coded assumptions
instead of using the more generic mechanisms provided by the SDK).
