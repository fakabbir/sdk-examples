An UNO Example in Python.

This example shows how to connect to LibreOffice and how to use the Spell Checker.

To get this working you must have:

   The grammar/spell packages. You can download the pt-BR at http://pt-br.libreoffice.org/projetos/projeto-vero-verificador-ortografico/ and the en-US is installed by default.

   You must use the Python version inside LibreOffice installation or
   you need to have the libreoffice-pyuno installed in your Python version.
   Use Python 3.3. This is the LibreOffice Python version.

This code will run on Linux or Windows. Maybe at Windows you will need to change the LIBREOFFICE location or add the Program folder at Windows PATH.
