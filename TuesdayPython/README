=============================
LibreOffice prints on Tuesday
=============================

This is a simple sample extension for LibreOffice written in Python.  It is
self contained in that it contains the full source to build itself. To do so,
unpack the oxt-extension with any program able to read the zip format. Running
the script './build' in the unpacked source tree, will then recreate the
extension (and possible modifications).

Following below is a description of all the files in this extension and how
LibreOffice learns what to do with them.

For licensing information see the file ./description/license.txt
